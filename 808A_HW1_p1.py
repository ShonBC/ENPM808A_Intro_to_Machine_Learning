For  this  problem,  please  use  the  dataset  in  the  link  below.   
Please  use  thefirst column as the sales data.  Others are predictors.  
Use the first twenty entries to create a regression model using the code 
snippet included in the class  discussion.   Then  use  the  remaining  
points  to  judge  the  performance of the predictor.  The code snippet 
also an available resource with the book(Hands on ML, HML Book)
